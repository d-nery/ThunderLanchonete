# ThunderLanchonete

This is an experiment with flutter, this app consists in a simple "shopping cart" app with a balance, backed by firebase and inspired by ThundeRatz' "ThunderLanchonete", which is a simple friendly snack bar.

In this app you can check your TB (fictional currency) balance, add more and also check all of the products prices and availability.
